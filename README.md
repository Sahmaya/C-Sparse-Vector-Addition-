# C Sparse Vector Addition 

<h1>Sparse Vector Addition in C (Linked List Implementation)</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This project implements sparse vector addition in C using linked lists. It efficiently stores and processes sparse vectors, where most elements are zero, by keeping only nonzero values in a sorted linked list.
